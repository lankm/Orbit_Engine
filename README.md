For the first bit I'm just going to be messing around in rust. Since you are reading this, the actual implementation will happen later. Also the name say's engine but thats a bit of a stretch. I'm new to this idea so I don't know how presentable it will be.

# Orbit Engine
A project to get myself introduced into rust and performance programing.

## purpose
The purpose of this is to demonstrate proper orbital mechanincs which are not present in some space games. These games have more 'Star Wars'-like physics instead of embracing the challenges of realistic travel. It should be more akin to KSP but we'll see.

## limitations
Fundamentally, this engine will be designed around newtonian/keplerian mechanics. Einstien's Relativity is just a bit too complex for computers in general.
