# Rust Shenanigans
Was a repo for an 'orbit-engine'. Might be one day but honestly, I'm using this repo to learn rust inside and out. Will be messing around with things like fixed-point numbers, octrees, a unit system, and maybe a custom data structure or two. Really a lot of prototyping because if I do anything, I want to do it right.
